Marathons hurt and wind is the embodiment of all that is evil. That's what I've learned from the two marathons I've run thus far. Case in point:

Last year, I followed the 18-week, 55-70 mile plan from [<u>Pete Pfitzinger's Advanced Marathoning</u>](https://smile.amazon.com/Advanced-Marathoning-2nd-Pete-Pfitzinger/dp/0736074600). I blew up pretty bad around mile 20 to mile 22 (I don't remember, exactly, *because. it. hurt.*), as is apparently typical of beginner marathoners that aren't sure of if/when they'll hit the dreaded Wall and not being prepared for it. I remember my calves screaming and my hips almost fully tightening up in that last 10k. From this I just assumed that maybe I just didn't have the muscular endurance to last the whole race, as I felt I was holding a pretty comfortably-hard pace prior to entering the pain cave. I decided to pick a higher mileage plan in hopes of remedying this, so I went with a sort-of ad-hoc modification based off of the 18 week 85 mile and 18 week, more than 85 mile plans from the same book, with most workouts taken as-is from the 85+ mile plan, with some extra miles here and there on some runs depending on how I felt at the time.

philly %>%
  group_by(MarathonName) %>%

```

There were a lot more runs and not just miles in this year's prep. This was pretty much all due to the double days (pretty much all double recovery runs), as well as the warm up and cool downs of two tune-up race workouts that for some reason I decided to count as separate activities. And even though I missed some days completely due to some injuries, I still had almost 40 more runs in this time around. I got hit with a real sharp quad pain around the middle of September and popped back up in October that *forced* my stubborn self to take some days off. I believe that I sustained this injured thanks to my impatient and running my "easy" runs too hard while also not having as long of a base-building period prior to this marathon plan compared to last year.

### *Miles*

I'll start off with a simple histogram of how many miles I ran throughout each marathon prep.

```{r plotting, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#distance histogram
ggplot(data = philly, aes(x = Distance)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, aes(fill = MarathonName), colour = "black", boundary = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red","#338dff")) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
  xlab("Distance (mi)") + 
  ylab("Frequency") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of Miles Ran in All Runs") + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

Just like [last year](https://stevenewns.netlify.com/2017/04/18/marathon-training-plan-data-analysis/), I again can see the actual marathon itself and my one 24 mile run, the longest **Long Run** of the plan, all the way to the right of the plot. It also looks like I had less runs that were between 16-18 miles and more runs between 22-24 miles this year. This distribution is right/positively-skewed, with the majority of the runs being less than 12 miles. Also, as expected after choosing a higher mileage plan, the 2017 histogram has some taller bars, indicating a larger number of runs overall, with bars for the same distance being noticeably higher in 2017 compared to 2016.

The majority of my runs in this 2017 training block were around 4-6 miles, with the next highest frequency being from 10-12 miles. The fact that most of my runs were from 4-6 miles is not surprising when noting that the majority of my runs were recovery runs, which went from a minimum of 3 miles up to a maximum of 7 miles, for them most part. Sometimes I combined two recovery runs into one run due time constraints and more-so to my regrettable obsession with hitting as much of my planned mileage as possible at the expense of truly recovering from hard efforts.

```{r, un type counts, echo = F}
philly %>%
  group_by(MarathonName,RunCat) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  spread(key = RunCat, value = Count) %>%
  kable() # print as table
```

The above shows that for 2017, I actually had less workouts, long runs, and middle long runs (runs that're longer than a "general aerobic" run but shorter than a long run), but more recovery runs and general aerobic runs. This makes me think that, following the plan *correctly*, I would've been taking it a bit easier overall in this build-up, with a higher number of easier runs.. I believe the lower numbers for the workouts were due to me missing these runs thanks to injury. For example, let's look at those runs that fall under `Misc`:
```{r Misc runs, echo = F}
philly %>%
  filter(RunCat == "Misc") %>%
  select(Name,Date,RunCat) %>%
  kable()
```

4 of these runs were the warm up and cool downs to some tune-up race workouts, but the other 2 were runs I kept short due to injury, one physical, one mental. As mentioned earlier, I strained my quad twice in this build-up. I took a couple of days off in each instance, as I started to realize that I didn't have to hit *every* run on the schedule during the span of this plan and pushing through legitimate injury and not just some soreness or a niggle could have some legit long-term consequences. I can see the periods I took off highlighted by the empty spaces in the middle of September and October when looking at a plot of runs.
```{r show rest days, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
philly %>%
  filter(Marathon == "ph17") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, Distance)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#338dff", colour = "black") +
    theme_bw() + 
    xlab("Date") + 
    ylab("Miles") + 
    ggtitle("Runs Over Time :2017") +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(as.POSIXct("2017-09-05", format = "%Y-%m-%d"),
                             as.POSIXct("2017-10-25", format = "%Y-%m-%d")))
```

That *very* tiny bar around September 14th was where I hurt my quad for the first time within a mile and a half of the planned run, with the run the following day being cut short after 10 miles when the pain came back (again, due to my stubbornness). Then again, in the second half of October, the same pain came back right before a tune-up race workout, so I took 2 days off to be safe and avoid any further aggravation of my quad so as to not miss another workout.

Now, to look at the summary of both marathons plans' overall distance data:
```{r distance summary, echo = F}
philly %>%
  group_by(MarathonName) %>%
  select(Distance) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Distance), Median = median(Distance), StdDev = sd(Distance),
            Min = min(Distance), Max = max(Distance), Count = n()) %>%
  kable()
```

So, since I have a skewed distribution, I'd want to look at median to compare measures of center. I can see the median number of miles ran in a run for 2017 is 7 miles, which is lower than 10 miles for last year (this year's mean was also lower), which I can infer was due to the higher number of the shorter recovery runs this time around, especially during the double-run days. And again, we see that the max distance here is, of course, the actual marathon, even though something must have been up with my GPS watch or the course, as it says I ran about .15 miles more-so than the actual race distance. Like I needed *that*.

Now let's look at the total number of miles ran each month, with an initial expectation to see the total rise month by month.
```{r}
philly %>% 
  select(Month,MarathonName,Distance) %>%
  group_by(Month,MarathonName) %>% 
  summarise(sum = sum(Distance)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = sum, fill = MarathonName)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("red","#338dff")) + 
    theme_bw() + 
    xlab("") + 
    ylab("Total Miles") + 
    ggtitle("Total Miles by Month")
```

Somewhat against what was expected, my total mileage in November was actually shorter this time around, while the other months all did have higher totals. It makes sense in hindsight that September and October had a bit lower of total mileage than August, as August was the only month in which I did not take time off due to injury. But, I believe I also took some more days off in November this year because I was feeling quite fatigued and was worried I would go into the race too beat up, which I still think I did in the end (but it could've been worse, right?).

```{r, echo = F}
philly %>%
  filter(Month == "Nov") %>%
  group_by(MarathonName) %>%
  summarize(Count = n()) %>%
  kable() # print as table
```

Looks like I did look to rest up a bit more this year, so maybe I'm learning.

### *Cadence*

Last year, my cadence generally increased month over month, albeit *barely*, and ended up averaging between 170 and 180. Let's look at how I fared this year.

```{r cadence by month, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'} 
#avg. cadence grouped by month
ggplot(data = philly, aes(Month, Avg.Cadence)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Month)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Month), outlier.colour = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_bw() + 
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("Avg. Cadence (Steps/Min)") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  ggtitle("Average Cadence by Month") + 
  facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

I had a much more consistent cadence this year, as indicated by the smaller boxes for each month, and also my median average cadence for each month in 2017 was highest than the highest median average cadence from last year, which is good. It suggests my running form has become more efficient. But, there was a decrease in those last 2 months. Could this have been due to fatigue? Or to due more speed workout which included recovery intervals, during which I was quite content to plod on during. Either way, the median average cadence was in the high 170's, which is an improvement compared to 2016.

Also, I have some significant outliers in those first two months, which I again would assume were mainly recovery runs, as I was mainly concerned with keeping my heart rate down so I could actually recover on them than I was with making sure my cadence was optimal. 
```{r check min cadence, echo = F}
philly %>%
  filter(Month %in% c("Jul","Aug"),
         Marathon == "ph17") %>%
  select(Name,Date,Avg.Cadence) %>%
  arrange(Avg.Cadence) %>%
  head(8) %>%
  kable()
```

Huh, so my tempo runs, where I would've hoped my cadence would've been higher to better prepare me to run at a higher cadence during the actual marathon, were the only runs with an average cadence lower than 170. This should instruct me to focus more on picking up my pace during these types of workouts in my next build-up.

I could investigate to see if this was due to having more speed workouts as the plan progressed, in which I would assume my cadence was typically higher), or could it have been due to improved form from an ever-increasing volume so as to average closer to the suggested 180 steps per minute.

### *Heart Rate*

Another metric to look at would be my **average heart rate** during runs over the course of my training. Compared to the rise of my cadence, I would expect that my average heart rate would have decreased over time, as my fitness would have increased due to higher mileage and an increasing number of workouts.

```{r heart rate over time, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
hr16 <- philly %>%
  filter(Marathon == "ph16") %>%
  ggplot(data = , aes(Date, Avg.HR)) + 
    geom_line(aes(group=1, colour = "red")) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = T, colour = "red") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
    xlab("2016") + 
    ylab("Average Heart Rate") + 
    ggtitle("Average Heart Rate Over Time") + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100, 160))

hr17 <- philly %>%
  filter(Marathon == "ph17") %>%
  ggplot(data = , aes(Date, Avg.HR)) + 
    geom_line(aes(group=1, colour = "green")) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = T, colour = "#338dff") + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "none") +
    xlab("2017") + 
    ylab("Average Heart Rate") + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(100, 160))

grid.arrange(hr16, hr17, nrow = 2)
```

So, it looks like my average heart rate stayed pretty steady over the course of this plan, with possibly a minuscule increase there at the end, which may lend credence to my hypothesis that I went into the race too beat up, so my heart rate was higher than it would've been had I been fully rested. But, a more positive indication to note is that my average heart rate started and ended at a significant lower amount than last year, indicating that I was more fit this year, which I would've hoped, even with a pretty unstructured break from the end of last year's marathon up to this year's plan start.

```{r HR by month boxplot, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#avg. HR grouped by month
ggplot(data = philly, aes(Month, Avg.HR)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Month)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Month), outlier.colour = "black", alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  xlab("Month") + 
  ylab("Avg. Heart Rate") + 
  ggtitle("Average Heart Rate per Month") + facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

Opposite to cadence, I had more variance this each month in 2017, but good = 1st 4 months were all lower, less outliers this time, November similar. I would assume it's due to more recovery runs at lower heart rates making these boxes taller

Now let's look at cadence and heart rate by Run Type as well for comparisons.

```{r cadence by run type, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'} 
#avg. cadence grouped by month
philly %>%
  filter(RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%
  ggplot(aes(RunType, Avg.Cadence)) + 
    geom_jitter(aes(colour = RunType)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = RunType), outlier.colour = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
    xlab("Run Type") + 
    ylab("Cadence") + 
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Cadence per Run Type") +
    facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

Similar to cadence over time, I had a higher average cadence for each run type, and less variance among each run type, especially in the workout category. I see the my long runs had highest median cadence. This is something I can be happy with, as the length of these runs mimic the marathon the most, so I would hope to keep a higher and more consistent cadence through these runs. My recovery runs had the lowest cadence, which does not surprise me as I find it difficult to keep up cadence and my pace slows down. My workouts were the second lowest this year, but with the most outliers. From my experiences last year, where workouts had the lowest average cadence, I can be quite confident that the recovery jogs between intervals and tempos were the cause of this, similar to how in recovery runs I find it hard to keep up cadence while slowing down, which I am working on in the spring build-up.

Now I will again check to see the relationship between my average cadence and m average heart rate.

```{r cadence by hr, echo = FALSE, messages = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
philly %>%
  filter(RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%  
  ggplot(aes(Avg.Cadence, Avg.HR)) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour = RunType), na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw() +
    xlab("Cadence") + 
    ylab("Average Heart Rate") + 
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(110, 160)) +
    ggtitle("Average Heart Rate by Cadence") + 
    facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

Similar to last year, there is no concrete relationship here. But, we can note that there's again more evidence of the higher  average cadence overall, as most dots are above 170 and hovering near 180 steps per minute. Also, the long runs are (as suggested by the box plot) higher up, while recovery runs are more towards the bottom.

We can now flip this run type analysis from cadence to hear rate.

```{r heart rate by run type, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
#avg. cadence grouped by month
philly %>%
  filter(RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%
  ggplot(aes(RunType, Avg.HR)) + 
    geom_jitter(aes(colour = RunType)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(fill = RunType), outlier.colour = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") + 
    xlab("Run Type") + 
    ylab("Avg Heart Rate") + 
    guides(fill=FALSE) +
    coord_flip() + 
    ggtitle("Average Heart Rate per Run Type") + 
    facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

Well, barring those higher outliers in the recovery runs, which I cna only assume are those more "beat-up" runs where I would've been skipping the run and fully recovering between those harder efforts. But, I was much better at keeping my hear rate lower this time around druing recovery runs and doing so at a relatilvey more consistent rate. Average heart rate decreased a but more this year, but was also a bit more variable, while my genearl aerobic runs increased in variety quite a bit. I would assume this is due to some middle-long runs I remember being more difficult than they should've been. 

workout hear rate similar good b/c usually have targets to higt, low variance, much lower vraiance in recovery = more consistenet even if run too hard, long runs a bit more varies this year, GA much more varies. Overall each run type lower

### Pace

Let's now check out my average pace over time, split out by Run Type. I would hope that it would have decreased, just as average heart rate did, due to both increased form and increased fitness, as well as possibly due to decreased outside temperatures making it easier to run faster. 

```{r avg pace by runs, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
philly %>%
  filter(RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%
  ggplot(aes(as.POSIXct(paste(month(Date),'/',day(Date), sep=""),format="%m/%d"),
                            Avg.Pace, colour = RunType)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(fill = NA) +  
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
    xlab("Date") + 
    ylab("Average Pace (mile/minute)") + 
    ggtitle("Average Pace Over Time") + 
    labs(caption="") + 
    facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

So we see a very slight general decrease overall, but it's not very linear at all, so it does not seem to be that significant. Let's split these into seperate scatter plots by run type.

```{r avg pace by runs - seperate, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
philly %>%
  filter(Marathon == "ph17",
         RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Date, Avg.Pace, colour = RunType)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(fill = NA) +  
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank()) +   
    xlab("Date") + 
    ylab("Average Pace (mile/minute)") + 
    ggtitle("Average Pace Over Time") + 
    labs(caption="") + 
    facet_grid(RunType ~ .)
```

And, we see that workouts had the lowest average pace, which seemed to actually decrease a tad until about halfway through the plan, but there was a variety of different workouts with different focuses, so this really isn't something we can glean anything out of. Long Runs start to decrease in average pace, possibly due to an increase in outside temperature from July to August causing me to slow down, but then we see a rapid increase, which start sto taper off at the end there. Normal runs seemed to have a more gradual increase over time, but it sped up a bit compared to at the start. Then we see that recovery runs increased down even more so compared to Long Runs, but also had a drop as temperatures cooled (or fitness increased, either or. Maybe both). There was then a quick uptick at the end there, which I would assume would be due to slowing down even more as I tapered for the race, with the 2 slowest recovery runs happening just before the race. We then see the race there, at about 7:10 min/mile, which, while I am happy with my results, I would *love* to get this down under 7:00 min/mile in my next marathon, Philly 2017, with the goal of running about 6:50 min/mile so as to break 3 hours!

Let's see if my elevation gain had any affect on my average heart rate. I expect that it would, since a larger eleveation gain meant I was climbing more, which requires more exertion, so I expect my average heart rate to be higher with a higher elevation gain.

```{r elevation and avg hr, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
philly %>%
  filter(RunType != "Race",
         RunType != "Misc") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Elev.Gain, Avg.HR)) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour = RunType), na.rm = TRUE) +
    geom_smooth(fill = NA, na.rm = TRUE) +
    theme_bw() + 
    xlab("Elevation Gain (ft.)") + 
    ylab("Average Heart Rate (BPM)") +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(110, 160)) +
    ggtitle("Average Heart Rate by Elevation Gain") +
    facet_grid(~ MarathonName)
```

So it looks like there was a very slight increase in average heart rate as elevation gain increased. And while the increase was not that large in magnitude, it seemed to be quite consistent for the majority of the x-axis. So this went in line with my expectation a bit.hing that heart rate would have been when I was pushing myself to max exertion, which would have only occured during a workout, or during the race. But since this was a marathon, and not a 5K, I will assume it was another heart rate monitor inaccuracy, which is something we just can't always prevent.
